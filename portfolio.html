	<h2>Rover Phone Home is a project where we are required to create multiple graphs for us to conclude which region a rover with multiple functions is located. 
	     The potential regions in which this rover could be located are the Rocky Mountains, Inland Forests, Marsh Lands, Desert Plains, and Tropical Islands. 
	     Using multiple graphs, we concluded that the rover was in the The Rocky Mountains since our process allowed us to use the process of elimination and 
             common facts in order to get this result.</h2>
